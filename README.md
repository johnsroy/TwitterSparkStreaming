Nobody can deny the importance of social media in today’s society. a lot of businesses collect their audience’s insight, feedback, and interests through twitter activities. many businesses have realized that a prominent analysis on social media activities can help them better understand the patterns in their customer’s behavior. often, the feedback from social media can change rapidly and real-time analysis of that feedback is an essential process in the success of a business. as a result, there are different ways to get a better understanding of how people respond to a new product, brand or an event. One smart way would be extracting the top #tags related to our desired topic during specific periods of time, like every few minutes since tweets with #tags have a higher engagement rate.
